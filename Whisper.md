# Whisper ASR Example

This project demonstrates how to use the Whisper ASR library to transcribe audio files.
Whisper is an automatic speech recognition system developed by OpenAI that's capable of converting spoken language into written text.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the example code on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Whisper library (install using `pip install whisper`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Az-har/whisper.py
   cd whisper-asr-example
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```sh
   pip install whisper
   ```

### Usage

1. Place your audio file (e.g., `audio.mp3`) in the project directory.

2. Open the `transcribe_audio.py` file and modify the `audio_file` variable to match the name of your audio file:

   ```python
   audio_file = "audio.mp3"
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```sh
   python transcribe_audio.py
   ```

4. The transcribed text will be printed to the console.

### Example

Here's an example of how to use the Whisper ASR library to transcribe an audio file:

```python
import whisper

# Load the Whisper base model
model = whisper.load_model("base")

# Specify the path to the audio file
audio_file = "audio.mp3"

# Transcribe the audio
result = model.transcribe(audio_file)

# Print the transcribed text
print(result["text"])
```
